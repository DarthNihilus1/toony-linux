# Toony Linux

A minimalistic Linux launcher for Toontown Rewritten and Toontown: Corporate Clash.

## Configuration

* Copy `accounts.example.yaml` to `accounts.yml` and fill in your account details.
  (multiple toons are supported)
* If using Corporate Clash: install it via Wine and the launcher and launch the game
  once. That way the script can find the installation path correctly
* Run the script
* If using Toontown Rewritten: Use `update` command to download the game
* Run `lc <toon1> <toon2>`
* Optional: `ds <district>` to set the district for newly-spawned Clash toons.

## TODO

* Graphical interface
* Multicontroller capabilities
* OCR and combo recognition
